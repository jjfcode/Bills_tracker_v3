# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature will enable the Bills Tracker application to synchronize bill due dates and payment reminders with external calendar systems such as Google Calendar, Microsoft Outlook, and Apple Calendar. Users will be able to automatically create calendar events for their bills, receive calendar-based notifications, and maintain visibility of their financial obligations within their existing calendar workflows.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a bills tracker user, I want to connect my external calendar accounts, so that I can sync my bill due dates with my existing calendar system.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user accesses calendar settings THEN the system SHALL display available calendar providers (Google Calendar, Microsoft Outlook, Apple Calendar)
2. WHEN the user selects a calendar provider THEN the system SHALL initiate OAuth authentication flow
3. WHEN authentication is successful THEN the system SHALL store encrypted calendar credentials securely
4. WHEN authentication fails THEN the system SHALL display clear error messages and retry options
5. IF multiple calendar accounts exist THEN the system SHALL allow users to select which calendar to use for bill sync

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a bills tracker user, I want my bill due dates to automatically appear as calendar events, so that I can see my financial obligations alongside my other scheduled activities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a new bill is added THEN the system SHALL create a corresponding calendar event on the due date
2. WHEN an existing bill is modified THEN the system SHALL update the corresponding calendar event
3. WHEN a bill is deleted THEN the system SHALL remove the corresponding calendar event
4. WHEN a bill is marked as paid THEN the system SHALL update the calendar event status or remove it based on user preference
5. IF calendar sync fails THEN the system SHALL log the error and retry automatically
6. WHEN creating calendar events THEN the system SHALL include bill name, amount, category, and payment details in the event description

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a bills tracker user, I want to receive calendar-based reminders for upcoming bills, so that I can get notifications through my preferred calendar application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating calendar events THEN the system SHALL set reminder notifications based on the bill's reminder_days setting
2. WHEN reminder_days is set to 3 days THEN the system SHALL create a calendar reminder 3 days before the due date
3. WHEN multiple reminder preferences exist THEN the system SHALL create multiple calendar reminders accordingly
4. WHEN calendar reminders are triggered THEN the user SHALL receive notifications through their calendar application
5. IF reminder creation fails THEN the system SHALL fallback to internal notification system

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a bills tracker user, I want to control which bills are synced to my calendar, so that I can maintain privacy and avoid calendar clutter.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing sync settings THEN the system SHALL provide options to sync all bills, specific categories, or individual bills
2. WHEN category-based sync is selected THEN the system SHALL only sync bills from chosen categories
3. WHEN individual bill sync is selected THEN the system SHALL provide a checkbox for each bill to enable/disable sync
4. WHEN sync preferences are changed THEN the system SHALL immediately apply changes to existing calendar events
5. WHEN bills are excluded from sync THEN the system SHALL remove existing calendar events for those bills

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a bills tracker user, I want to customize how my bills appear in my calendar, so that the calendar events match my personal organization preferences.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuring calendar sync THEN the system SHALL allow customization of event titles using templates (e.g., "[Bill] {name} - ${amount}")
2. WHEN configuring calendar sync THEN the system SHALL allow selection of calendar color coding based on bill categories
3. WHEN configuring calendar sync THEN the system SHALL allow setting event duration (all-day vs. specific time slots)
4. WHEN bills have different categories THEN the system SHALL apply category-specific formatting to calendar events
5. IF custom templates are invalid THEN the system SHALL use default formatting and notify the user

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a bills tracker user, I want to handle calendar sync conflicts gracefully, so that my data remains consistent between the bills tracker and my calendar.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN calendar events are modified externally THEN the system SHALL detect changes during next sync
2. WHEN conflicts are detected THEN the system SHALL provide options to keep calendar version, bills tracker version, or merge changes
3. WHEN network connectivity is lost THEN the system SHALL queue sync operations for retry when connection is restored
4. WHEN calendar API limits are reached THEN the system SHALL implement exponential backoff retry strategy
5. WHEN sync errors occur THEN the system SHALL maintain a sync log accessible to users for troubleshooting

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a bills tracker user, I want to import existing calendar events as bills, so that I can consolidate my financial obligations into the bills tracker.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing import functionality THEN the system SHALL scan connected calendars for events matching bill patterns
2. WHEN potential bill events are found THEN the system SHALL present them for user review and selection
3. WHEN importing calendar events THEN the system SHALL extract relevant information (name, date, amount if present)
4. WHEN imported events lack required fields THEN the system SHALL prompt user to complete missing information
5. WHEN import is completed THEN the system SHALL create corresponding bills in the tracker with proper categorization

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a bills tracker user, I want to manage calendar sync status and troubleshoot issues, so that I can maintain reliable synchronization between systems.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing sync status THEN the system SHALL display last sync time, sync success/failure status, and number of synced bills
2. WHEN sync errors occur THEN the system SHALL provide detailed error messages and suggested solutions
3. WHEN requesting manual sync THEN the system SHALL immediately attempt to synchronize all pending changes
4. WHEN disconnecting calendar accounts THEN the system SHALL remove all synced events and clear stored credentials
5. IF sync performance degrades THEN the system SHALL provide options to optimize sync frequency and batch sizes
