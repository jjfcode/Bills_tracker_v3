## Available Demos

### 1. Next Month Filter Demo
**File:** `demo_next_month_filter.py`

Tests the new "Next Month" period filter functionality.

```

**What it does:**
1. Creates test bills with different due dates
2. Tests the next month filtering logic
3. Shows all bills in the database
4. Provides instructions for testing the UI filter

## Running the Demos

1. Make sure you're in the `Bills_tracker_v3` directory
2. Ensure the database exists (run the main app first if needed)
3. Run any demo script with: `python demo/[script_name].py`

## Testing the UI Features

After running the demo scripts, you can test the UI features:

1. Start the main application: `python run.py`
2. Navigate to the Bills view
3. Use the Period dropdown to select different time periods:
   - All
   - This Month
   - Last Month
   - Previous Month
   - **Next Month** (new feature)
   - This Year
   - Last Year

## Notes

- Demo scripts will create test data in your database
- You can delete test bills through the UI if needed
- The "Next Month" filter correctly handles year transitions (December â†’ January)
