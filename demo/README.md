## Running the Demos

1. Make sure you're in the `Bills_tracker_v3` directory
2. Ensure the database exists (run the main app first if needed)
3. Run any demo script with: `python demo/[script_name].py`

## Testing the UI Features

After running the demo scripts, you can test the UI features:

1. Start the main application: `python run.py`
2. Navigate to the Bills view
3. Use the Period dropdown to select different time periods:
   - All
   - This Month
   - Last Month
   - Previous Month
   - **Next Month** (new feature)
   - This Year
   - Last Year

## Notes

- Demo scripts will create test data in your database
- You can delete test bills through the UI if needed
- The "Next Month" filter correctly handles year transitions (December â†’ January)
