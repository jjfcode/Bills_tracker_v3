# Migration Guide: Transforming Bills Tracker v2 (Console) to v3 (Desktop Application)

This document provides a step-by-step plan to convert the console-based Bills Tracker (v2) into a modern desktop application (v3) with a graphical user interface (GUI).

---

## 1. Project Setup
- Create a new folder: `Bills_tracker_v3` (already done)
- Set up the following structure:
  - `src/gui/` for GUI code
  - `src/core/` for business logic (reuse from v2)
  - `src/utils/` for helpers
  - `resources/` for icons and themes
- Add a new `README.md` and `.gitignore` (already done)

## 2. Identify Reusable Code
- Review v2 code in `src/`:
  - Database logic (`db.py`)
  - Validation (`validation.py`)
  - Data compression, integrity checks, etc.
- Copy reusable modules to `src/core/` in v3.
- Remove or refactor any code that is tightly coupled to the console interface.

## 3. Choose GUI Framework
- Recommended: `customtkinter` (modern look, easy to use)
- Alternative: `tkinter` (standard), `PyQt6` (advanced)
- Add GUI dependencies to `requirements.txt` in v3.

## 4. Design the Main Window
- Create `src/gui/main_window.py`:
  - Set up the main application window (title, size, icon)
  - Add a sidebar or menu for navigation
  - Reserve space for the bills table and details

## 5. Implement Bills Table
- Create a table widget to display bills (use `customtkinter` or `ttk.Treeview`)
- Add sorting, filtering, and search features
- Connect the table to the database logic in `core/db.py`

## 6. Add Bill Management Dialogs
- Create dialogs/windows for:
  - Adding a new bill
  - Editing an existing bill
  - Viewing bill details
- Use validation logic from `core/validation.py`

## 7. Integrate Core Logic
- Ensure all data operations (add, edit, delete, search) use the core modules
- Refactor any console-specific code to work with GUI events and callbacks

## 8. Implement Notifications & Reminders
- Add pop-up reminders or desktop notifications for due bills
- (Optional) Integrate with email or system notifications

## 9. Polish the User Experience
- Add icons, themes, and visual feedback
- Implement error dialogs and confirmation prompts
- Add keyboard shortcuts and accessibility features

## 10. Testing & Debugging
- Test all features thoroughly
- Fix bugs and handle edge cases
- Optimize performance for large datasets

## 11. Documentation & Packaging
- Update `README.md` with usage instructions
- Document new modules and GUI components
- Package the app for distribution (e.g., with `cx_Freeze` or `PyInstaller`)

---

## Tips
- Migrate features incrementally: start with core data display, then add editing, then advanced features.
- Keep business logic separate from GUI code for maintainability.
- Use version control (git) to track progress and changes.
